# Data Science Practicum 2021

This Data Science course is taught at the Faculty of Science, Masaryk University, in the fall semester 2021/2022.  

My plan is to give 12 lectures, each focused on one ML technique and dataset (typically from [kaggle.com](http://kaggle.com)). The emphasis has been on coding and practicing data science skills, rather than the theoretical background.

## Course Info

The course is now in the [IS Course Catalogue](https://is.muni.cz/), look for [M7DataSP](https://is.muni.cz/auth/course/sci/podzim2021/M7DATASP) Data Science Practicum (Praktikum z pokročilé datové vědy). 

The course is scheduled for **Thursdays, 10:00-11:30**. The first lecture will take place on **September 16**. To be invited to the classes, enroll to the course in [IS](https://is.muni.cz/). 

No special knowledge is expected but you should have at least one year of coding experience, either R or Python. I like diverse crowds; students from different faculties and specializations are encouraged to enroll (if still in doubt, let me know to be paired with a more experienced student). The course will be taught in English if at least two students will be interested, otherwise in Czech.

## Acknowledgement

This work would be impossible without tutorials provided by [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials) and [RStudio](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorials/). I also get a lot  of inspiration from numerous Kagle notebooks and blogs all over the internet. Sometimes, in a time pressure before the lecture, I might have forgotten to properly link all my sources. If this is the case, I would be grateful if you correct my mistake, either by a pull request or sending me a message. Thank you.
